# Auto-ML-for-Business-Analytics

In this project I have used H2O AutoML to apply automatic machine learning to a business analytics problem with the H2O AutoML interface in Python. The task was to create a model that can predict whether a customer will sign up for a term deposit based on demographic information and details of the marketing campaign.

A list of viable models was generated, with the best model (an XGBoost model) having an accuracy of 93.44%.
